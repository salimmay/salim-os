🌌 SalimOS - The Cyberpunk Web Operating System

An immersive, high-performance "Web Operating System" portfolio. SalimOS goes beyond a static website by simulating a full desktop environment with physics, gamification, and reactive particle systems.

🔴 Live Demo
🚀 The Next Evolution (Current Build)

The latest update transforms SalimOS into a highly customizable visual experience, introducing a Global Theme Engine and Interactive Physics Layers.
🌟 New Major Features

    ⚙️ Settings App: A fully functional control panel to customize the OS experience.

        Theme Picker: Change system-wide accent colors (Neon Blue, Cyberpunk Pink, Emerald, etc.).

        Display Control: Real-time Brightness & Saturation sliders (CSS Filters).

        Input Mods: Switch between custom cursors (Plasma Blade, Mech HUD, Retro Pixel).

    ⚔️ "Void Ronin" Mode: An interactive background where high-velocity mouse movements unsheathe a digital katana to slice through flying enemy drones.

    🚀 "Mecha Cockpit" Mode: A homing-missile simulation with an "Itano Circus" anime missile effect and a 3D perspective grid.

    🧘 Zen Mode: One-click toggle to hide all UI elements (Dock, Icons, TopBar) for pure visual immersion.

    📊 System HUD: A draggable, floating widget displaying simulated real-time stats (CPU, RAM, Network, Thermal).

✨ Core Features
🎨 The Interface

    8+ Dynamic Backgrounds:

        Void Ronin: Velocity-based sword combat simulation.

        Event Horizon: Black hole physics simulation with accretion disk.

        Tower Defense: Hex-grid defense system against virus particles.

        Saiyan: Power-up aura mechanics.

    Physics Engine: Toggle gravity to make desktop icons fall, bounce, and collide using rigid-body physics.

    Retro CRT Mode: A global shader effect adding scanlines, chromatic aberration, and screen curvature.

🛠️ App Ecosystem

    💻 Interactive Terminal: Includes a "Hacker Typer" mode—type gibberish to generate real code on screen.

    📂 File Explorer: Fully navigational file system with breadcrumbs and protected directories.

    📝 VS Code: Integrated code viewer with syntax highlighting.

    🧠 SalimAI: A heuristic chatbot simulating an AI assistant.

    🎵 Music Player: Lofi station with audio visualization.

    🕹️ Games: Includes Snake.exe and Minesweeper.

🕹️ Hidden Mechanics & Secrets

    Konami Code: ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A (Unlocks a special high-contrast color scheme).

    Dimension Cut: In Void Ronin background, move your mouse faster than 15m/s to trigger a critical slash effect.

    Gravity Prank: Find the ⚡ button in the dock to break the laws of physics.

    Blue Screen: Try deleting the System32 or Root folder in the File Explorer.

🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

The Final Feature Set

        Next.js 14 App Router structure.

        Global State Management: ThemeContext (Colors/Display), SoundContext (SFX), AchievementsContext (Gamification).

        Window Manager: Fully draggable, minimizable, and stackable windows (z-index handling).

    Visuals & Immersion

        Dynamic Backgrounds: Void Ronin (Sword combat), Mecha Cockpit (Missiles), Event Horizon (Black Hole).

        Physics Engine: Gravity mode that makes icons fall and collide.

        Zen Mode: One-click hiding of all UI for pure visual appreciation.

        God Mode (Root): Inverted colors and hue rotation via Kernel injection.

    Apps & Utilities

        ⚙️ Settings: Full control over Accent Colors, Display (Brightness/Saturation), and Input (Custom Cursors like Plasma Blade).

        📁 File Explorer: Navigation history, breadcrumbs, and password-protected folders (admin / 1234).

        💻 Hacker Typer: Turbo-typing simulation that rewards the "Konami Code" upon completion.

        📊 System HUD: Real-time simulated resource monitoring.

        🏆 Achievement System: Tracks user exploration and sorts unlocked badges to the top.
